### Week 3 Achievements:

* Understood Amazon EC2 fundamentals and instance types:
  * General Purpose (T2, T3, M5) - balanced compute, memory, networking
  * Compute Optimized (C5, C6) - high-performance processors
  * Memory Optimized (R5, X1) - fast performance for large datasets
  * Storage Optimized (I3, D2) - high sequential I/O

* Mastered EC2 Pricing Models for cost optimization:
  * On-Demand - pay per hour/second, no commitment
  * Reserved Instances - 1 or 3 year commitment, up to 75% discount
  * Spot Instances - up to 90% discount, can be interrupted
  * Savings Plans - flexible pricing model

* Proficient with AMI (Amazon Machine Images):
  * Pre-configured instance templates
  * Custom AMI creation for reusability
  * AMI sharing and marketplace
  * AMI lifecycle management

* Successfully deployed Node.js application on Linux EC2:
  * Launched Amazon Linux 2023 instance
  * Configured Security Groups (SSH port 22, HTTP port 80, custom app port)
  * Connected via SSH using PEM key pair
  * Set up Elastic IP for static public IP
  * Installed Node.js, npm, and Git
  * Cloned AWS FCJ User Management application (Node.js + Express)
  * Configured MySQL database connection
  * Set up Express-Handlebars for templating
  * Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete users)
  * Installed PM2 for process management and auto-restart
  * Configured PM2 startup script for system boot
  * Set up Nginx as reverse proxy
  * Implemented logging and monitoring

* Successfully deployed Node.js application on Windows EC2:
  * Launched Windows Server 2025 instance
  * Connected via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
  * Configured Windows Firewall rules and Security Groups for RDP port 3389
  * Installed Git for Windows, Visual Studio Code, Node.js runtime
  * Configured PATH environment variables
  * Cloned application repository and installed npm packages
  * Configured MySQL database on Windows
  * Deployed Node.js application with PM2-Windows or node-windows
  * Tested application functionality

* Compared Linux vs Windows deployment:
  * Linux: Lightweight, better performance, lower cost, suitable for production workloads
  * Windows: Familiar GUI, .NET integration, enterprise tools
  * Both: Full Node.js support, production-ready
  * Best practices: Choose based on team expertise and workload requirements
